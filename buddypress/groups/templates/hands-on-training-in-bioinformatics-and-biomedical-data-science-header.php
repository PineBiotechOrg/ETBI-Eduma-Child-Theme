		<p>Online 3-month training program in Bioinformatics that will will provide an in-depth overview of standard processing tools applied to various molecular data types and explore how Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is used in oncology, neuroscience and agriculture. Each week, participants will meet online to discuss various aspects of RNA-seq and Whole Genome/Exome -seq analysis and practice together in processing, analysis and interpretation. The program will be supported by online modules that participants must complete independently. We will also offer an opportunity to take this training further and explore exciting projects or develop new ones based on publicly available datasets.</p>
