		<p>
			Bioinformatics is becoming a priority for researchers and biology students, however resources easily accessible to students are limited and not well developed for both research and training. Louisiana Tech University recognizes the need for quality bioinformatics training and has partnered with the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network and with Pine Biotech to offer a modern project-based curriculum for qualified students.
